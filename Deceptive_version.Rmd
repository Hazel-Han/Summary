### Content and difference
In original data product, graph 4 drew distribution of mass shootings happened per day in 2015. From that we can see on average America has mass shootings almost everyday and it seems no difference of number of gun shootings from day to day, which made America like a crazy and dangerous country. 

However when replaced day distribution by month distribution, I found the original data product hide trend of mass shootings. In fact a clear trend shows in new chart, from May to Sep number of mass shootings are almost twice than the other months.

### Data wrangling and develop process:
First let's take a look of original data
![](images/data1.PNG)
Original data product try to explain a fact that America happens mass shooting everyday and its drew 300 more small grids, which make people feel gun problem is serious and gun shootings happen everyday. For thought with 300 more grids it is hard to tell trend and hide truth, I sum up daily accident and draw by month, with new chart I found summer leads gun shooting easily. In new chart I use months as x axis and shooting counts in each month as y axis.

Actually if draw by day it gives a micro view while by month we see a macro view. My chart distracts people's attention from everyday to those severe months, it make people feel America not happens gun shooting everyday but only in particular months. What government should do is not decrease number of guns but enhance security during summer.

### Road map with enhancements:
Check trend in different years to see whether summer is always a peak of gun accidents and if so find reasons of it.

In original data product, graph 9 shows a slow decreasing trend of gun homicides from 1990 to 2010. It used rate of gun homicides death per 100,000 people. From this grpah audience feel firearm homicides have declined over past two decades. 

However when I replaced y axis with count instead of rate, the trend changes. From new chart we can see different from trend shows in original chart which is decreasing recent years, in new chart we see a valley shape. Specifically, count of gun homicides decrease from 1994 to 2000 then it shows an increase trend from 2000 to 2009. In this case, firearm homicides actually is increasing recently.

### Data Wrangling and develop process:
Let's take a look of dataset
![](images/data2.PNG)
Instead using rate of death per 100,000 people, I changed y axis into absolute count. Because thirty years is a long time period and population in America changed a lot (1980:226,545,805,2010:308,745,538), if only use rate as y axis it may hide truth. Using absolute count audience can see the real situation and trend. 

When drawing chart I found if add count in 2010 which show little decrease, the increasing trend after 2000 will be affected so I remove year 2010. Still originally range of y axis is from 0 to 20k, in order to show a explicit trend I adjusted it into 10k to 17k. 

### Road map in future:
Try to find gun homicides count after 2010 and to see if there is a clear increasing trend.

In original data product, graph 15 shows trend of control gun ownership and protect right of own guns in recent twenty decades. From graph we see more and more people began protect the right of own guns and less people support control gun ownership. 

But when go deeply to dataset I found not all races tend to support right of own guns. In new chart I drew, we can see actually white race are big fan for gun owning, from 2007 white people's number of support gun right surpass number that control gun right. However when we see Black and Hispanic people, their lines of control and protect are almost two parallels. In another word, no much changes showed among black and hispanic people. So we cannot say support for gun ownership has sharply increased and in fact except white people no one is keen on supporting gun ownership.

### Data wrangling and develop process:
Let's take a look of dataset:
![](image/Data3.PNG)
Due to different classification belong to different files, here I only put the race one.

When looking at original dataset, I found except overall view it also shows other classification such as gender, age, race, education and etc. After drew chart for each classification I found different classification show various trend. Then I pick race instead of overall which used by original product as x axis, for race variable make new chart different from original chart most. 

I think changing x axis to race make audience pay attention to difference between white people and other races. It is not all people in America tend to support gun ownership but only white people do, and else races still tend to control gun ownership. 

During process explore dataset, I found except race other classification also show different trend from original dataset. But race shows most obvious difference, I chose race as x axis.

### Road map for enhancement:
Draw graph for every classification to see people with what kind of characters tend to support gun ownership and vice verse.
